# nyx-art

A few definitions before we start:


**Individuation**: process to achieve a sense of individuality that separates the individual from others.

**Generative art**: a process of algorithmically generating new ideas, forms, shapes, colors or patterns. First, you create rules that provide boundaries for the creation process. Then a computer follows those rules to produce new works on your behalf. In the NFT world, it means that the artist provide a set of traits and an algorithm randomizes these traits and create one-of-one art (no 2 final arts are the same).


**Soul**: As participants of the experiment did their individuation, they received an NFT ERC-721 token called “Soul”, with their personality traits represented on the token art.

**Ferrymen**: generative art (NFT ERC-721) token given to Soul holders who participated on the experiment.


## Introduction

As part of the NYX experiment, 2 NFT ERC-721 tokens were created:
- Soul NFT: art derived from the individuation traits of each holder
- Ferrymen NFT: generative art

This repository contains the code and summary for the generative art of Souls and Ferrymen. Other repositories for this project: <br/>

## Souls creation

The process for Souls was:
Individual minted a Soul NFT (website + Etherium Smart Contract)
Completed their individuation (Discord with custom bots)
Their Soul NFT was revealed on OpenSea (python), the art based on their individuation traits. The chance of two Souls being the same is 1 in 7,194,667,451,811,840,000.

The code created by this project and used to generate the Souls art is innovative. It requires less than 5 minutes for the Soul art to be reviewed, involving several systems (Discord, SQL database, virtual server/droplet in Digital Ocean). Normally NFTs are revealed in batches and may take a few days.
